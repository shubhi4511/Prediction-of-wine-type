Prediction of Wine type using Deep Learning

We use deep learning for the large data sets but to understand the concept of deep learning, we use the small data set of wine quality.
we can find the wine quality data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which is available for free. The aim of this article is to get started with the libraries of deep learning such as Keras, etcand to be familiar with the basis of neural network. 

About the Data Set : 
The data set consist of 12 variables that are included in the data. Few of them are as follows – 

Fixed acidity : The total acidity is divided into two groups: the volatile acids and the nonvolatile or fixed acids.The value of this variable is represented by in gm/dm3 in the data sets.
Volatile acidity: The volatile acidity is a process of wine turning into vinegar. In this data sets, the volatile acidity is expressed in gm/dm3.
Citric acid : Citric acid is one of the fixed acids in wines. It’s expressed in g/dm3 in the data sets.
Residual Sugar : Residual Sugar is the sugar remaining after fermentation stops, or is stopped. It’s expressed in g/dm3 in the data set.
Chlorides : It can be a important contributor to saltiness in wine. The value of this variable is represented by in gm/dm3 in the data sets.
Free sulfur dioxide : It is the part of the sulfur dioxide that is added to a wine. The value of this variable is represented by in gm/dm3 in the data sets.
Total Sulfur Dioxide : It is the sum of the bound and the free sulfur dioxide.The value of this variable is represented by in gm/dm3 in the data sets.
